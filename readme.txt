## Project :Text mining and classification
## 
guide:
1. If you have a list of URL to extracte "author","publish_date","content","title"
 run predict.py in URL and substitue url with your own.
2. If you have already gathered those information,
 run inclassCNN_train.py in CNN and BinaryclassSVM in SVM to model machine learning models

Note:
SVM and CNN are two models bulit seperately to detect :1.SVM: whether certain records belongs to rubbish/invalid information or not.
2.CNN :which specific type does a single record belongs to? content/author/publish_date/title?
